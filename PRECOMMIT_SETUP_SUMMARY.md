# Pre-commit Hook Setup Summary

âœ… **Successfully configured pre-commit hooks for automatic requirements.txt synchronization!**

## What was installed:

### 1. Pre-commit Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- **UV Sync Requirements Hook**: Automatically runs `uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt` when `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` changes
- **Code Quality Hooks**: Black (formatting), isort (import sorting), trailing whitespace fixes, etc.
- **File Validation Hooks**: YAML, JSON, TOML validation

### 2. Development Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)
Added to `[project.optional-dependencies]`:
- `pre-commit>=3.3.0`
- `black>=23.3.0`
- `isort>=5.12.0`

### 3. Setup Script (`setup-precommit.sh`)
- Automated setup script for new developers
- Installs dependencies and configures hooks
- Runs initial validation

### 4. VSCode Tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`)
Added new tasks:
- **"Run Pre-commit"**: Manual execution of all hooks
- **"Setup Pre-commit Hooks"**: Run the setup script

### 5. Documentation (`docs/PRECOMMIT_SETUP.md`)
- Complete usage guide
- Troubleshooting instructions
- Workflow examples

## ðŸŽ¯ How it works:

### Automatic (The Main Feature)
```bash
# 1. You modify pyproject.toml (add/remove/change dependencies)
vim pyproject.toml

# 2. You commit your changes
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Add new dependency"

# 3. Pre-commit hook automatically:
#    - Runs: uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
#    - Adds the updated requirements.txt to your commit
#    - Shows: "ðŸ”„ Updating requirements.txt from pyproject.toml..."
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Run all hooks manually
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Run just the requirements sync
uv run pre-commit run uv-sync-requirements --all-files

# Use VSCode Command Palette
# Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "Tasks: Run Task" â†’ "Run Pre-commit"
```

## âœ… Tested and Working

The setup was tested and confirmed working:
- Pre-commit hooks installed successfully
- Requirements.txt synchronization tested and verified
- All hooks pass validation
- VSCode integration configured

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The pre-commit hooks are now active and will:
1. **Automatically keep requirements.txt in sync** with pyproject.toml changes
2. **Format your Python code** with Black and isort
3. **Validate file formats** and fix common issues
4. **Run before every commit** to maintain code quality

Your development workflow is now enhanced with automatic dependency management! ðŸŽ‰
